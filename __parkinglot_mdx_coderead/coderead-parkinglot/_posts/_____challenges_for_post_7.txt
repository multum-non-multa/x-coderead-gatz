--> input --> [... process ...] -> output

e.g. shake maker

recipe in => ... => shake out

many times a function depends on a certain type of input

e.g., len() takes a sequence type, e.g., string, but NOT a number

and functions often return a certain type

input() returns a string

how to determine --- the type() function
returns the type

print(type(input("What is your name?" )))
print(type(len(input("What is your name?" ))))

type conversion (aka 'casting') required if
type == string but need integer or float

int()
float()

if len() => integer
str(len())
then can concatenate


exercise / challenge

given a random 2-digit number
from input()
print the sum of the two digits as a type of float
e.g.
```bash
Type a two-digit number: 43
7.0
```
involves
type checking
string subscripting
conversion
arithmetic operations

More math

+ = * /

** exponent

%

--
<!-- order of operations
essentially same as algebra
'PEMDAS'
from L => R
left to right
===
() parentheses <==
===
** exponents
===
* multiplication & / division
===
+ addition & - substraction -->

homework
using ** and +
produce the value 9
1 1 1 3

--

now introduce math module

> compare ** with math.pow()

** returns integer
pow returns float

>>> import math
>>> math.pow(4,5)
1024.0
>>> 4**5
1024
>>>


> other modules in math

...

> also see random module

cover operations for bmi calc (without mentioning bmi challenge)

bmi calculator
height = input("Enter the height in inches ")
weight = input("Enter the weight in pounts ")

bmi = weight / height**2


note:

>>> int(34.967)
34
>>> math.ceil(34.967)
35
>>> math.floor(34.967)
34
>>>


math rounding
e.g.
print(8 / 3)
2.66666666666666
int()
not great
rather use built-in round()

round((8/3))
options in round()
round((8/3), 3)

or use floor division

8 // 3
same as math.floor(8/3)




Beware the inexactitude of floating point numbers.
Note what happens here:
>>> 100 * 1.12
112.00000000000001
>>>
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html

So it's a good idea to choose a rounding so as not to factor in that inexactitude.
Not an issue now, but we'll return to it when we do comparison operators and conditional statements.

shorthand arithmetic operations

increment

score = 0
could do
score = score + 1
or use shorthand
score += 1

halving
>>> volume = 85.0
>>> volume /= 2
>>> volume
42.5
>>> volume /= 2
>>> volume
21.25
>>>

exponential growth
>>> gain = 2
>>> gain **= 2
>>> gain
4
>>> gain **= 2
>>> gain
16


revisit f-strings



can do a lot but not sure can use shorthand:

>>> h = 12.33
>>> m = False
>>> msg = f"When you reach {h} then go to {h + 100} and return {m}"
>>> msg
'When you reach 12.33 then go to 112.33 and return False'
>>> msg = f"When you reach {h} then go to {h += 233} and return {m}"
  File "<input>", line 1
    (h +)
        ^

alternative: lambda functions
 msg = f"When you reach {h} then go to {(lambda x: x + 1)(h)} and return {m}"
>>> msg
'When you reach 12.33 then go to 13.33 and return False'
>>>

Your Life in Weeks
Instructions

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

Example Input
56
Example Output
You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/RjqBViZQpyVTv7XY6cfA

Hint
There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
Try copying the example output into your code and replace the relevant parts so that the sentence is formated the same way.
