### Note

<h4 style="color:firebrick;font-weight:bold">When you see a code snippet below, dump it in a repl and play around with it.  It will help you build an understanding of, and memory for, Python.</h4>

## Using the Python Shell in Replit

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/cd2c6d9aeaf9492f838104eea47d47da" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

The acronym 'repl' stands for  the 'read-evaluate-print loop'.  The interpreter reads the input, evaluates it, and prints a return value to the console.

Make use of it for small snippets of code without having to keep running a program in a file.  It's helpful for testing out Python features quickly.

```python
>>> city = "Des Moines"
>>> city
Des Moines # returns the value
>>> 3 / 4 # difference between / and // ?
0.75
>>> 3 // 4
0
```
