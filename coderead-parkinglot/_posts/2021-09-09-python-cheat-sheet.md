<!-- Integers
Integers are whole numbers.

Floating Point Numbers
Floats are numbers with decimal places. When you do a calculation that results in
a fraction e.g. 4 รท 3 the result will always be a floating point number.

Strings
A string is just a string of characters.
It should be surrounded by double quotes.

String Concatenation
You can add strings to string to create
a new string. This is called concatenation. It results in a new string.
Escaping a String
Because the double quote is special, it denotes a string, if you want to use it in a string, you need to escape it with a "\"
              my_number = 354
              my_float = 3.14159
              my_string = "Hello"
              "Hello" + "Angela"
              #becomes "HelloAngela"
              speech = "She said: \"Hi\""
              print(speech)
              #prints: She said: "Hi" -->
