<h3>Note</h3>

When you see a code snippet below, dump it in a repl and play around with it.
It will help you build an understanding of, and memory for, Python.

<Headings.myH4>Data Types Revisited </Headings.myH4>

Let's go a bit further with some of the things mentioned in an earlier post - _see_ [Variable Types in Python](https://multum-non-multa.github.io/code/2021/08/31/variables-string-methods-functions.html).

As mentioned, we may or may not be able to use a Python built-in function with the data. For example, you can't use

the `len()` function on a number, but only a sequence like a `string`

the `[ ]` subscripting operators on a number, but, once again, only a sequence like a `string`

Sometimes, however you are able to convert from one type to another.
